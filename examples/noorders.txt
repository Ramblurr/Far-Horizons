Note from the gamemaster:

    Unfortunately, I did not receive your orders for the current turn on
    time.  Please make an effort to be on time for the next turn.  If you
    DID send me orders but they arrived late, I will use them for the next
    turn (but keep in mind that many of them may not work properly).  You
    may also change and re-submit them to me based on the information in
    THIS status report.  However, if you do re-submit them, please make
    an effort to submit them by the deadline.  Thank you.
