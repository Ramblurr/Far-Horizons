EXAMPLE FIRST TURN IN FAR HORIZONS (under development...)

; If you have other ideas for a first turn, please leave comments on this document with your additions. Most of the orders aren’t usable on turn one.

; Any line that begins with a semicolon is a comment and won’t be processed by the code
; Some comment lines are auto-generated by the code, such as “; Place combat orders here”
; You can add comments to structure your orders and leave notes for future reference
; I am using comments to explain my orders to the players who are learning the game
; Orders will be emailed in the format below to farhorizonsorders@gmail.com for processing
; Each set of turn results will come with a template to use for the next turn
