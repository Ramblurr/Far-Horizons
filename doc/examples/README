This folder includes example files generated by Far Horizons when a new game is created, as well as an example set of orders to submit for Turn 2. I have added this folder so that both GMs and players alike can get a better understanding of the game before going through the process of downloading, compiling, and initiating the code.

NOTE: Far Horizons treats Turn 1 as the empire setup that is sent to a new player at game start. The example orders in this folder would therefore be for Turn 2 (the first set of orders a player can submit for a game).
