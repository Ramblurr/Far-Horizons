This folder includes files created by players to help in the process of learning and/or playing the game.

At some point there were a number of player aids, including:

* Far Horizons Wiki (Source: Archive.org snapshot of Far Horizons Wiki, https://web.archive.org/web/20110912034639/http://www.cetnerowski.com/farhorizons/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/)
* Strategy Guide (Source: PlayByMail.net Forum Posting, http://playbymail.net/mybb/showthread.php?tid=73&pid=200#pid200)
* Beginner's Guide (Source: PlayByMail.net Forum Posting, http://playbymail.net/mybb/showthread.php?tid=73&pid=200#pid200)
* Empire Planning Spreadsheet (Source: PlayByMail.net Forum Posting, http://playbymail.net/mybb/showthread.php?tid=73&pid=206#pid206)

These have been lost over the past two decades for various reasons, including hard drive failure, lapsed web sites that were not archived, and possibly even player death.

If anyone has copies of the files listed above, or anything else related to Far Horizon that should be archived here for future use, please email me.
