This folder includes files created by players to help in the process of learning and/or playing the game.

At some point there were a number of player aids, including:

* Far Horizons Wiki
* Strategy Guide
* Beginner's Guide
* Empire Planning Spreadsheets

These have been lost over the past two decades for various reasons, including hard drive failure, lapsed web sites that were not archived, and possibly even player death.
