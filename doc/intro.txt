This day may very well be a defining moment in SP_NAME's history. Today is the 
day you rose to power, and made it a priority to take your people to the stars.

Your scientists have long known of nearby solar systems with planets rich in 
natural resources; however, your kind lacked the technology to traverse the vast
interstellar distances. That is, until today. Your scientists just completed a
successful faster-than-light jump. The whole of the galaxy is now within reach.
The scientists also speculate that a few of these solar systems may contain
planets with the precise pressure, temperature, and atmospheric parameters
suitable for SP_NAME, though perhaps someday, with the right technology,
you will be able to transform any rock ball into a SP_NAME paradise.

How your species flourishes among the stars is now in your hands. Whether you
expand rapidly and colonize distant worlds to ensure the longevity of your
species, or take to constructing mighty warfleets to exterminate all lesser
forms of life, or seek to influence the history of the Galaxy itself, you will
make these decisions. You are at a crossroads.
